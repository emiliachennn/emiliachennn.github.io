<p> The animated children's TV series is a spin off of <strong>Octonauts</strong>. The Octonauts 
expand their exploration beyond the sea and onto land; with new rides and new friends, 
they prepare to protect any habitats and animals at risk on land or under the water.
There are <strong>new characters, vehicles, and missions</strong> in the new series, where every episodes
is a new adventure.

<p> I enjoy "Octonauts: Above & Beyond" because it emphasizes the <strong>importance of helping 
the ecosystem</strong> in a way that is engaging and educational for children. The use of adorable
and diverse characters makes the series even more enjoyable. My favorite character is <em>Kwazii,</em>
the adventurous cat with a pirate-like attitude, as his bold personality adds excitement to
every mission.
